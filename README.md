# Local LLM Assistant with Chroma + RAG

A lightweight RAG-based assistant using ChromaDB as a local vector store and Sentence-Transformers for embeddings.

## Features
- Vector search over your notes, PDFs, or any text
- Chroma as local, persistent DB
- Easy to plug in OpenAI or local LLMs

## Usage
1. Put your `.txt`,`.db`, `.pdf` files into `data/`
2. Run `scripts/loader.py` to load them
3. Use `app.py` to query your assistant


# 🔁 High-Level Workflow: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This project uses a modular RAG pipeline to generate SQL queries based on user questions and database schemas. Below is the step-by-step flow of how each component interacts:

---

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Flow

1. **User Prompt (app.py)**
   - The user selects a `.db` file (e.g. `sakila.db`)
   - Enters a natural language question (e.g. *"List all customers who rented a film in 2022."*)

2. **Schema Extraction (`SQLSchemaManager`)**
   - Loads the schema from the SQLite file
   - Formats each table/column as a text chunk
   - Stores the schema as embeddings in ChromaDB under a named collection

3. **Collection Setup (`ChromaDBManager`)**
   - Manages persistent Chroma collections
   - Creates or retrieves collection by name
   - Used by `SQLSchemaManager` and `RAGPipeline`

4. **RAG Orchestration (`RAGPipeline`)**
   - Coordinates the RAG process:
     - Retrieves relevant schema context
     - Builds a custom prompt
     - Calls an LLM to generate the SQL query

5. **Retrieval (`RAGRetriever`)**
   - Uses Chroma to find the most relevant schema chunks
   - Based on semantic similarity to the user question

6. **Prompt Construction (`PromptBuilder`)**
   - Builds a prompt with:
     - Retrieved schema context
     - The user question
   - Ensures the LLM gets structured input

7. **LLM Generation (`RAGGenerator`)**
   - Sends the prompt to a local or cloud-based LLM
   - Returns a complete SQL query

8. **Answer Return**
   - The final SQL query is returned to `app.py`
   - Optionally executed or displayed to the user
